                        <p>My name is Sam Garfield. I was born just outside Philadelphia in the beautiful suburbia that is Bucks County. I now attend Tufts University, where I am a senior majoring in Computer Science.</p>

                        <p>I love playing the guitar. I'm self-taught and going on my 3rd year. I also love being active. I especially enjoy running, cycling (I cycled across the country this summer!), and hiking, but anything outdoors is awesome. I also like playing chess.</p>
